# Ames Housing Project from Kaggle


**Primary Objectives:**  

- Creating and iteratively refining a simple regression model that will predict the price of a house at sale
- Providing business insights through reporting and presentation.
- Getting comfortable submitting to Kaggle

## The Modeling Process
**Practicing:**
  
- train-test split
- cross-validation
- grid searching for hyperparameters
- strong exploratory data analysis to question correlation and relationship across predictive variables
- code that reproducibly and consistently applies feature transformation (preprocessing library)
- consideration of evaluation metrics
- consideration of the baseline score
- how can the model be used for inference?

### The Data Science Process

**Data Cleaning and EDA**
- Are missing values imputed appropriately?
- Are distributions examined and described?
- Are outliers identified and addressed?
- Are appropriate summary statistics provided?
- Are steps taken during data cleaning and EDA framed appropriately?
- Does the student address whether or not they are likely to be able to answer their problem statement with the provided data given what they've discovered during EDA?

**Preprocessing and Modeling**
- Are categorical variables one-hot encoded?
- Is investigating or manufacturing features with linear relationships to the target necessary?
- Have the data been scaled appropriately?
- Does the student properly split and/or sample the data for validation/training purposes?
- Feature selection to remove noisy or multi-collinear features
-Test and evaluate a variety of models to identify a production algorithm

**Evaluation and Conceptual Understanding**
- Accurately identify and explain the baseline score
- Select and use metrics relevant to the problem objective
- Is more than one metric utilized in order to better assess performance?
-Interpret the results of their model for purposes of inference

**Conclusion and Recommendations**
- Is it clear how the final recommendations were reached?
- Are the conclusions/recommendations clearly stated?
- Does the conclusion answer the original problem statement?
- Address how findings of this research can be applied for the benefit of stakeholders
- Are future steps to move the project forward identified?
